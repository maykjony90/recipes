Ingredients:
 - 2 eggs
 - 2 spoons milk
 - 1 small knob of unsalted butter
 - 1 teaspoons salt

Directions:
 1. Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl with a pinch of salt and beat well with a fork.

 2. Heat a small knob of butter in a small fraying pan on a low heat, once the butter is melted and bubbling, add the eggs and move the pan around to spead them out evenly.

 3. Using a spatula, ease around the edges of the omelette, then fold it over in a half. When it starts to turn golden brown underneath, remove the pan from the heat and slide the omelette on to a plate.
